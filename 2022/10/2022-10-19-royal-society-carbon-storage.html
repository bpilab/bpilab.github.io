<p>The Royal Society has recently released a new report on geological carbon storage: storing CO<sub>2</sub> kilometres below the Earth’s surface to remove it from the atmosphere for millenia.</p>

<p>The report explores:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The challenges of this storage and the variability between sites</li>
  <li>Safety measures to prevent CO<sub>2</sub> escape</li>
  <li>The need for future research and policy developments</li>
</ul>
