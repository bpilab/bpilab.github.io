<p>The work of the BPI, which is very wide ranging, covers large areas of fluid mechanics and surface science. It may be useful to look at the list of publications on the BPI web site from the past 2 years (and longer)  to get an in depth idea of the research.</p>

<p>All the students, post-docs and faculty at the BPI are members of the University of Cambridge, and enjoy the same academic freedom as all other members of the University; our research is not directed by any external body. Over the past 20 years, the BPI has become an internationally recognised centre of excellence in fluid mechanics and surface science, with a distinguishing feature being the collaboration across subjects and the use of fundamental and new knowledge to inform a very wide range of problems with immediate relevance for the processes in the Earth, the environment or industry.</p>

<p>The BPI is highly interdisciplinary, and we have many colleagues with
whom we collaborate both in the University of Cambridge and more
broadly with the UK and globally. The academic freedom, the spirit of
intellectual curiosity and the vast range of fundamental and important
problems for which our research can provide new insights, are key.</p>

<p>In the papers you will find that our research involves both experiments and  theoretical calculations and includes the following subjects :</p>

<p>i. geophysical and geological fluid mechanics, including the dynamics
  of volcanic eruptions and the ash plumes produced during large
  explosive eruptions, and the processes below surface driving these
  eruptions including the cooling and crystallisation of magma; the
  processes controlling the formation of planetary interiors, and the
  fluid mechanics of mixing in the deep ocean, which informs models of
  climate change given that the ocean has a large mass and hence
  capacity for thermal energy and carbon dioxide. We are also
  interested in sea ice formation and its impact on ocean circulation,
  the dynamics of glaciers and their coupling with subglacial systems,
  and the dynamics of river recharge and discharge and the erosion of
  topography by rivers.</p>

<p>ii. environmental fluid mechanics, including the dynamics of gravity
driven flows and buoyant plumes, with relevance for the air flows in
hospitals and other buildings (on the web site you can see a very
current film about our work in modelling the ventilation of hospitals
relevant for the present coronavirus pandemic), and also experimental
and theoretical models of avalanche dynamics, relevant for landslides
and also snow avalanches.  We have some highly novel experimental
systems which enable measurement of the forces between particles in
such flows as well as the speed of the particles, and this has the
potential to transform models of these phenomena, which are becoming
increasingly important for civil defence in mountainous areas.  There
is also a programme on desert dune migration and structure, which is
of particular relevance in the context of promoting sustainable
agriculture, and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems (avoiding
desertification).</p>

<p>iii. Our work on air flows in buildings is also relevant for the
design of low energy buildings which use ideas of natural ventilation
to reduce the energy associated with ventilation and cooling. In this
work, we have been developing innovative control strategies to
identify how to minimise the energy use associated with ventilation
systems. We are also exploring the dynamics of bubble plumes used for
oxygenation of water reservoirs, and particle plumes, which are
relevant for understanding the environmental impact of possible deep
sea mining processes.</p>

<p>iv. the fluid mechanics of carbon capture and storage (CCS), which is
one part of the IPCC plan to reduce atmospheric carbon emissions,
especially for processes which are hard to decarbonise, including
cement and steel manufacture. Our work focusses on the flow of
CO<sub>2</sub> at high pressure through subsurface porous rocks
(aquifers) in order to understand where CO<sub>2</sub> spreads if it
is sequestered into such aquifers at depths of 2-3km below the
surface, and how it interacts with and displaces the brine which
presently occupies many of these aquifers. The complexities of and
research interest in these flows arise from the often heterogeneous
structure of the rock, and the density and viscosity contrast between
the CO<sub>2</sub> and the original brine in the reservoir, leading to
gravity driven flow and capillary trapping and dissolution of some of
the CO<sub>2</sub>. Our work involves experimental modelling of the
flow through model porous media, to test theories of the efficiency
and security of storage. We are also interested in the fluid mechanics
of drilling wells; many wells will be need to be drilled to access
subsurface aquifers if we are to implement CCS at scale, and
understanding more about the fluid mechanics of drilling will help in
this endeavour.</p>

<p>v. experiments and modelling of micro-encapsulation of various
materials with relevance for drug delivery in the body for
example. The encapsulation process involves the formation of a
near-spherical surface of material to enclose the reactive agent. The
surface is created through formation of an emulsion, and then the
addition of the encapsulant material to the surface of droplets in the
emulsion. These are sintered to form a shell, and they then enclose
the material within. They may have a size of order a few microns, and
have a range of purposes, from protecting active materials within
biological washing powders prior to their use, to providing a novel
means of drug delivery in the body. A novel application of some of
this work has been directed to the clean up of polluted waste water
which is produced in some industrial processes.</p>

<p>vi. there is a large research effort exploring the surface chemistry
associated with the deposition of material on the walls of machines or
pipes or other surfaces, sometimes known as fouling. In many
industrial processes, such deposits can build up on surfaces,
degrading the performance of the systems (such as in heat exchangers
for example) : determining how to reduce the build up of such
deposits, or to remove such deposits is key across industry, and
especially the chemicals industry. This fundamental work is also
relevant for modelling some of the flows which can occur in porous
rocks, where the interaction of the fluids with the solid surfaces can
have a leading order impact on the flow evolution.</p>

<p>vii. other research is exploring the process of corrosion on surfaces,
and developing approaches to reduce this corrosion; this is important
for large structures, such as offshore wind turbines, which are
exposed to very hostile conditions with salty water.</p>

<p>viii. research on the fundamental processes involved in droplet break
up and the development of models to predict such droplet break up
using numerical computation. We have world leading approaches to such
modelling which is relevant for modelling atomisation, particularly of
non-Newtonian fluids (i. e., the break up of a liquid into a series of
droplets such as occurs with spray painting, or with ink jet
printing).</p>

<p>ix. We have also been interested in geothermal power generation and
the associated problem of heat storage in aquifers and the potential
for seasonal cycling of energy so that there is an energy source in
winter captured in the summer: these processes rely on flow through
porous aquifers, and this forms another strand of our current
interests in flow in porous rocks. Our research focusses on how hot
water spreads through a porous aquifer, carrying the thermal energy,
and the potential to recover this thermal energy at a later time by
drawing this water back out from the aquifer.</p>

<p>There are many other problems which we are exploring as well. If you would like the research papers explaining some of the above problems in more detail please look at our web site, or get in touch.</p>
