				<title>2021 REF results published</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The results of the REF2021 assessment have been published, with the University of Cambridge and the BPI’s parent departments once again being ranked among the best in the country. Our Earth Sciences department ranked highest overall in their field, producing work that is “world-leading in terms of originality, significance and rigour”, and our Chemistry, Engineering and Mathematical Sciences departments were similarly acclaimed, coming second nationally in their fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These results highlight the strength of our research environment and outputs, and the significant impact that our research has across the world. They demonstrate Cambridge’s leadership across a wide range of disciplines. They are testament to the imagination, visionary thinking and hard work of Cambridge researchers, who, with their many partners around the world, are making a real difference to people’s lives.” - &lt;em&gt;Vice-Chancellor Prof Stephen Toope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Dynamics of deep-submarine volcanic eruptions</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric Newland, &lt;a href=&quot;/user/nm441&quot;&gt;Nicola Mingotti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/user/aww1&quot;&gt;Andy Woods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deposits from explosive submarine eruptions have been found in the deep sea, 1–4 km below the surface, with both flow and fall deposits extending several km’s over the seafloor. A model of a turbulent fountain suggests that after rising 10–20 m above the vent, the erupting particle-laden mixture entrains and mixes with sufficient seawater that it becomes denser than seawater. The momentum of the resulting negatively buoyant fountain is only sufficient to carry the material 50–200 m above the seafloor and much of the solid material then collapses to the seafloor; this will not produce the far-reaching fall deposits observed on the seabed. However, new laboratory experiments show that particle sedimentation at the top of the fountain enables some of the hot, buoyant water in the fountain to separate from the collapsing flow and continue rising as a buoyant plume until it forms a radially spreading intrusion higher in the water column. With eruption rates of 106–107 kg s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, we estimate that this warm water may rise a few 100’s m above the fountain. Some of the finer grained pyroclasts can be carried upwards by this flow and as they spread out in the radial intrusion, they gradually sediment to form a fall deposit which may extend 1000’s m from the source. Meanwhile, material collapsing from the dense fountain forms aqueous pyroclastic flows which may also spread 1000’s m from the vent forming a flow deposit on the seabed. Quantification of the controls on the concurrent fall and flow deposits, and comparison with field observations, including from the 2012 eruption of Havre Volcano in the South Pacific, open the way to new understanding of submarine eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On particle separation from turbulent particle plumes in a cross-flow</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cara James, &lt;a href=&quot;/user/nm441&quot;&gt;Nicola Mingotti&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;/user/aww1&quot;&gt;Andy Woods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Fluid Mechanics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present new experiments of particle-driven turbulent plumes issuing from a constant source of dense particle-laden fluid, with buoyancy flux, B, in a uniform horizontal current, u. Experiments show that a turbulent, well-mixed plume develops, in which the downward vertical speed w decreases with depth z according to w = 0.76(B/uz)(1/2) while the horizontal speed rapidly asymptotes to the current speed u, provided that the Stokes settling speed of the particles v &amp;lt; 0.92w. For v &amp;gt; 0.92w, the particles separate from the plume fluid, and their depth z increases according to the simple sedimentation trajectory dz/dx = v/u. As the particles sediment, they form clusters of particles, which lead to fluctuations in the particle load with position, but do not appear to change the time-average sedimentation speed. We explore the impact of these results for deep-sea mining, in which the fate of the plume water as well as the particles is key for assessing potential environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Comment on the BPI and Energy Transition</title>
				<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;comment-on-the-bpi-and-energy-transition&quot;&gt;Comment on the BPI and Energy Transition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will see from the wide range of research, we have a strong interest in helping to understand the science of climate change, including the work on ice dynamics and ocean mixing, and we have many projects related to the energy transition and the decarbonisation of the energy system, where our work is providing important new insights into new technologies, including CCS, energy storage, low energy building design, wind turbine optimisation. We also hold an annual Masterclass in Energy Supply and Demand to which all students in Cambridge can apply to attend - at this we have a host of speakers presenting the facts and data about the present and future energy system, in particular focussing on the technology and other challenges associated with decarbonising the energy system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy transition requires a large number of scientists and engineers to work with government, industry and society to try to assess and select optimal solutions for a decarbonised energy system. There are many choices and challenges with developing a decarbonised energy supply system and energy supply mix: it needs to have sufficient capacity to supply the energy which the world uses, both presently and going forward and we need to determine the fraction of this energy supply which each technology might contribute (eg wind or solar or geothermal or hydroelectric, or nuclear, …). Also knowledge of the present energy supply system is clearly very important in informing these decisions. On the demand side, there are very many technical challenges to develop new machines and other systems which can be powered by the new energy supply system, which will be largely delivered as electricity, or perhaps as hydrogen - compared to today, where we have a significant amount of energy delivered to the user in the form of natural gas (eg for heating over 20 million homes in the UK) or in petrol or diesel (for powering vehicles) which need to be replaced with electric vehicles or perhaps hydrogen powered vehicles, and alternative heating systems, which might include district heating systems or heat pumps, or other solutions. There are significant natural resource implications if all passenger vehicles become electric, given the large number of new batteries that we would need to manufacture. We also need new solutions for powering cargo ships and air travel. In addition, there are numerous opportunities for more efficient use of energy through new technological solutions, and better design, especially with buildings. Then the cement and steel industries, which are responsible for a significant fraction of global CO2 emissions, may require the development of CCS and the invention of lower carbon manufacturing processes. Finally, biofuels with carbon capture, offer a possible means to achieve negative emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of these problems, there is an enormous amount of important work to be done, on policy and economics as well as the science and engineering, and we are engaged in some of these problems in the BPI. Our hope is that many students and other researchers will join in this major activity to help address both the overarching questions of technology choices moving forward (since there are many different solutions) and the detailed questions which require detailed technical / engineering or research work in each part of the energy system - both relating to the supply and the demand sides, as well as energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will appreciate, industry plays a central role in the energy supply and energy demand systems, and so it is crucial that we collaborate and work constructively with industry across the whole spectrum to help translate our technical innovations into creating the new decarbonised energy system, and also to help influence the choices made by industry going forward using our detailed technical knowledge. As the energy infrastructure undergoes this enormous transition, there is a need for civilised discussion and debate, and the BPI as with other venues in the University, provides an ideal platform for such discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all want to evolve to a decarbonised energy system as rapidly as possible, but this is an enormous endeavour, and it will require tremendous innovation and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Comment on the BPI and Climate Change</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Anthropogenic carbon emissions have resulted in a major increase in atmospheric levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases, especially methane. This is leading to global warming, through the greenhouse effect and acidification of the oceans. There is therefore a pressing need to reduce future emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases. In line with this, the UK government have a plan to become net zero by 2050; the University of Cambridge plan to become net zero by 2048. Net zero means that there is no net emission of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reducing-carbon-emissions&quot;&gt;Reducing carbon emissions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/carbon-storage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BPI building&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching net zero is a major challenge, requiring a re-building of much of the national and international energy infrastructure, and has challenges in the supply and use of energy. The supply needs to change from oil, gas and coal to carbon free sources, which with today’s technologies largely implies new wind and solar power – future technologies may also unlock more of the potential energy in waves, such as tidal and geothermal. Presently over 80% of the world’s energy usage is supplied by fossil fuels, so the transition in the energy supply system is of a truly global scale. While this occurs, energy supply needs to be maintained; given the scale of the transition it is very likely that we will continue to use a significant but gradually diminishing inventory of fossil fuels, as the new renewable supplies come on stream. This future use of fossil fuels will release a substantial amount of greenhouse gases; technologies to reduce these emissions by making fuel production or consumption more efficient will therefore have an important impact on the overall atmospheric carbon levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technological-challenges&quot;&gt;Technological challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/engine-diagram-narrow.png&quot; alt=&quot;BPI building&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for energy spans many different uses, such as heating (for buildings), electricity for power (for use in lighting, powering computers, and other electrical goods), and energy for transport (cars, trucks, trains, ships and planes). Presently, in the UK 22 million homes use natural gas for heating; transitioning to a carbon free heating system will require replacement of all the gas boilers with other systems, such as electrical heat pumps or hydrogen driven heating systems. Transport is centred on petrol and diesel powered cars and trucks, jet fuel for planes and coke for shipping; we need new vehicles powered by carbon free energy sources. Electrical cars provide a replacement for petrol/diesel cars, but large trucks, with substantially greater mass and hence energy needs, may require alternative high density energy sources, such as hydrogen, and there are experiments under way exploring the use of hydrogen to power ships. Electricity is a direct product of wind and solar power, so with enough wind turbines and solar farms the electrical systems become zero carbon. In today’s power generation system, wind and solar do not provide all the electricity, and the electricity derived from natural gas is not carbon free; running electric cars or heat pumps on gas-derived electricity does not remove carbon emissions. Hydrogen could be generated from renewable energy using the electricity to electrolyse water, thereby making the hydrogen a zero carbon fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major challenge of the energy transition is that as well as requiring new infrastructure for both the supply and the demand systems, the electrical grid which transmits the electricity needs a substantial upgrade and redesign if it is to carry the energy for transport and heating as well as the electricity load for its present uses. For context, in the UK, the energy used at present for electricity, for heating and for transport are of comparable scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owing to the enormity of these challenges, another technology which has been discussed and which is included in the IPCC and the UK Committee for Climate Change plans is the process of &lt;a href=&quot;/research/carbon-storage&quot;&gt;Carbon Capture and Storage&lt;/a&gt;. Carbon Capture and Storage involves the removal of carbon dioxide from the gases produced when fossil fuels are combusted. At a power station, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be captured on a large scale and pumped underground into saline aquifers, where the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will displace the water and become trapped. CCS provides a means to prevent addition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere, while still using natural gas or other fossil fuels to generate electricity, leading to the expression “clean gas”. CCS is however an important technology in its own right, since there are other industrial processes which produce large fluxes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as cement manufacture. Using CCS to capture the large flux of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced at a cement factory or other such site would reduce those emissions into the atmosphere. It is also possible to grow biofuels, which absorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere, and then burn the fuels to produce electricity, while capturing the exhaust gases through CCS. This ultimately leads to negative emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and has been proposed as part of the net zero system for 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;energy-efficiency&quot;&gt;Energy efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/st-johns-college.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BPI building&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an important element of the energy transition is in designing more efficient systems, from small machines, phones and computers, to larger buildings and other infrastructure. Using less energy while maintaining present functionality offers huge opportunities to reduce carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BPI is involved in the development of many of the above solutions or topics related to the energy transition. Work is under way to reduce the frictional stresses associated with lubricants, making machines with moving parts more efficient so they use less energy in the first instance. We also have a major programme of research into carbon capture and storage, examining how much CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be injected into a subsurface aquifer, where it will spread in the aquifer, and how we can monitor where the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; migrates within the aquifer. Other research in the BPI is directed towards designing low energy buildings, while also keeping the environment in such buildings safe and well ventilated. We have projects exploring the production of batteries with higher energy capacity, and in using aquifers to store thermal energy on a seasonal basis. Some research in the BPI is directed towards understanding the detailed processes which occur in nature as a result of the climate change; we have projects exploring the long term evolution is ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic, modelling deep ocean mixing with a view to providing clearer quantification of the residence time of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorbed into the ocean, and work modelling avalanches and landslides which are becoming more frequent owing to changes in vegetation and forest fires as well as other effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taking-up-the-challenge&quot;&gt;Taking up the challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bpi-institute-narrow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BPI building&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome mutually respectful debate and discussion about the important issues of climate change and the energy transition, and encourage students to sign up for the annual BPI Masterclass in December. The energy challenge requires a very wide cohort of students and faculty to engage with the multitude of problems associated with driving forward the energy transition, ranging from the science and technology to the design of new policy, and the challenges of the social and economic constraints.
