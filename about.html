<hr />

<p>The BP Institute is an interdisciplinary Research Institute in the University of Cambridge, with a focus on fluid mechanics and surface science. The research spans subjects ranging from Volcano Dynamics, Carbon Sequestration, Ocean Mixing and Ice Sheet Evolution through to Microscopic Encapsulation Technology, Fundamentals of Wetting and Corrosion, Flow in Permeable Rocks, and most recently Granular Flows and Fluid Mechanics for the Energy Transition. The research is characterised by the combination of experimental data, theoretical modelling and numerical analysis to enable quantitative description of many complex and often multiphase flow processes.</p>

<p>The BPI was established in 2000 and has six permanent university faculty, a senior research fellow and lively cohort of over 30 PhD and Post-Doctoral researchers. The BPI has 5 parent departments in the University including Earth Sciences, Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Engineering.</p>

<h4 id="research-impact">Research Impact</h4>

<p>Over the past 20 years, research from the BPI has had significant
impact in a number of key areas including: design of low energy
ventilation systems for buildings, new insights into carbon
sequestration technology, improved functioning of lubricants, and
new encapsulation processes for bio-active washing powders.</p>

<h4 id="annual-masterclass">Annual Masterclass</h4>

<p>A flagship enterprise of the BPI is the <a href="events">Annual Masterclass in Energy
Supply and Demand</a>, which has been running for over 15 years and
includes lively debate on the energy transition, including
presentations and discussion of the technological challenges associated
with various sources of energy and challenges on reducing energy
demand.</p>

<p>The BPI was established through a generous endowment by BP plc in
1999, and over the past 20 years, the BPI has built up very strong
links with many partners in both academia and industry, working on
problems in the built environment, the energy sector and the
environment.</p>
